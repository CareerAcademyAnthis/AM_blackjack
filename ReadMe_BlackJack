This is the readme for our Blackjack project.
This project is created by the Morning Software Development class at the FWCS Career Academy
Students are learning to write code in Python and learning the tools that they will need
to use on the Job.

Students are using Trello as the kanban board, writing storys during a Sprint Goal meeting 
then using the cards to write the code.

Students will then have Scrum meeting daily to see what everyone has completed. Mob and paired programming 
will be use to along with individual work.
